      <h2>Recipes</h2>
      <p> I enjoy cooking and mixing up new cocktails. Unfortunately, I am prone to forget recipes if I don't write them down. I am compiling my favorite creations here, 
          for easy reference. I'm a believer in open source food as well as software!
      </p>
      <h3>Food</h3>
      <h4>Paccheri with spicy Italian sausage</h4>
      <ul>
            <li> 1 lb spicy Italian sausage, casings removed </li>
            <li> 1 medium white onion, finely chopped </li>
            <li> 1 cup dry red wine </li>
            <li> 3 tblsp tomato paste </li>
            <li> 1 lb dry paccheri pasta, or equivalent amount fresh </li>
            <li> Olive oil </li>
            <li> Grated Parmigiano </li>
            <li> Chopped fresh basil leaves </li>
            <li> Salt and pepper </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
            The key to this recipe is the quality of the sausage. I get mine at <a href=https://www.savenorsmarket.com/><b>Savenor's</b></a> in Cambridge. The
            wine will also make a difference, but not to the same degree. I usually use the Charles Shaw Red Blend from Trader Joe's, which will never be confused
            for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_Lafite_Rothschild#Price><b>Lafite,</b></a> but is a remarkably decent wine for such a ridiculously 
            low price.    
      </p>
      <p>
            Heat a few dashes of olive oil in a large pan, and sautee the onions until they are becoming translucent. Then add the sausage to the pan, breaking it
            apart with a wooden spoon as it cooks. When the sausage is mostly cooked, add the wine and tomato paste and mix well. Let simmer for several minutes, until
            the wine is cooked down and absorbed. Meanwhile, cook the paccheri until it is al dente. Add a few dashes of pasta water to the sauce, stirring until
            it begins to develops a thick, shiny texture. Then add the pasta to the sauce and cook for 1-2 more minutes on low heat. Season to taste with salt 
            and pepper. Stir in a bit of grated Parmigiano cheese. Serve warm with chopped basil leaves and a few more dashes of Parmigiano on top.

      <h3>Cocktails</h3>
      <p> 
            All cocktail names and recipes are, to the best of my knowledge, original. That said, I usually don't do more than a cursory Google search to see if
            somebody else has had the same idea. If you think you came up with one of these before me, send me an email. I'm happy to give credit where it is due!

      <h4>The Upper East Side</h4>
      <ul>
            <li> 1.5 parts apple brandy - I prefer <a href=http://www.stgeorgespirits.com/spirits/st-george-fruit-brandies/><b>St. George California Reserve</b></a> </li>
            <li> 1.5 parts sweet vermouth </li>
            <li> 0.25 parts Contreau or Grand Marnier </li>
            <li> Dash Angostura or orange bitters </li>
            <li> Luxardo cherry </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
            This is a twist on the French Manhattan from <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Drinking-French-Cocktails-Ap%C3%A9ritifs-Traditions/dp/1607749297><b>David 
            Leibowitz's book</b></a>, with the cognac replaced by apple brandy. I originally called it The Big Apple, but unsurprisingly there is already a cocktail
            with <a href=https://dailyappetite.com/big-apple-cocktai/><b>that name</b></a>. So instead I named it after the Uptown Manhattan neighborhood 
            where my parents used to live.

            Mix the liquors and bitters and stir well with ice. Strain and serve with the cherry.

      <h4>The Theodore Joseph</h4>
      <ul>
            <li> 1 part Glenfarclas 12 yr </il>
            <li> 1 part sweet vermouth </li>
            <li> 0.25 part Drambouie </li>
            <li> 0.25 part Nux Alpina </li>
            <li> Dash walnut bitters </il>
            <li> Luxardo cherry </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          Mix all liquors and bitters, stir well with ice. Strain and serve with the cherry and a large ice cube.
