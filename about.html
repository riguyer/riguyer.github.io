        <h2>About me</h2>
	<p>
	I am a general surgery resident at MGH, where I am working towards a career in academic pediatric surgery. I spent three years as a full-time postdoctoral 
	fellow in Allan Goldstein's laboratory, where I used single cell sequencing technology and traditional cell biology techniques to understand the transcriptional 
	control of neurogenesis in the postnatal enteric nervous system. My postdoctoral fellowship was funded by the Marshall K. Bartlett Research Fellowsihp from
	the MGH Department of Surgery, and by an individual F32 postdoctoral fellowship from the National Institutes of Health (F32DK121440). 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	My long-term goal is to become an independently funded surgeon-scientist with a basic science laboraotry focused on understanding the normal 
	development and differentiation of neural crest cells. I believe this will help to understand how developmental perturbations cause childhood diseases, 
	such as neuroblastoma and Hirschsprung Disease. New information from this work may lead to novel therapies.

	I was born in Boston, and grew up in New Jersey and North Carolina. I studied Economics and Mathematics at Davidson
	College. I started my medical education as an MD/PhD student at the University of Virginia, and began my PhD work at UVA in Ian Macara's laboratory. 
	When I was about halfway through my PhD, Ian accepted a new position at Vanderbilt University and moved his laboratory. I transferred to Vanderbilt,
	from which I graduated in 2015 with a PhD in Cell and Developmental Biology and then in 2016 with my MD. Since 2016 I have been a surgical trainee and
	postdoctoral researcher at MGH.

	Outside of work, I enjoy running, watching hockey, football, and soccer, cooking, working on my modest but growing wine collecteion, and spending time 
	with my family. I am a fan of the New York Football Giants, New Jersey Devils, and Tottenham Hotspur.
